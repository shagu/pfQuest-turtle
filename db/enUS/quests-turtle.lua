Undead are considered an abomination that is both alive and dead, think of them as something that breaks the balance between life and death magic.From what I can gather this Philosopher’s Stone was infused with either life force or souls itself, so it could be shadow magic too.You should return to your master or whoever told you to come seek me and have him help you get this, I will hold onto the vial until then for further examination.",
