Say, think you could do me a favor? I am expecting a package but it has yet to arrive. Could you go and check with Mishiki in Sen’jin Village and find out what happened to my special delivery? <Shagu blows a puff of smoke from his lips and then winks at you with a grin on his face.>",

Da quillboars be more aggressive than usual if dey came down from da roads to slay me messenger! I mean, Durotar be no walk in the park either, everything can kill ya here if ya not paying attention. I bet dey took his satchel after killing him and took it back to dey camp, or maybe dey are even carrying it on dem! Try killing some of da scouts. If ya do find da satchel take it back to Shagu and keep da pay fo yourself! Safe travels, mon. Loa guide ya steps.",

While I was doing my run from Ratchet to the Crossroads I saw a weird light on the mountain just south of Ratchet. There seems to be a ramp up just outside Ratchet, some raptors call the thing home though, so be careful. Now I don't know what it is, but you adventurin' types like to dive right in when it comes to dangerous situations right? It could be some HUGE deal like a demon cult or whatever for all I know and them doing nasty stuff to Ratchet would be very bad for MY business. Consider whatever spoils you find as payment.",

I may ask for your help in dealing with this later… For now, I have a task for you, one that will have quite the generous reward! The nearby Kolkar tribe is preparing for a raid on the Crossroads. I know this because I've used one of my tools, and you could say I sneaked into their tent and heard their Khan ordering it. This can be avoided however. You'll save many lives if you go down there and put an end to them all. They're all around the Oasis to the west. Once you're done come back to me. If I am not here simply touch the crystal again, I will know someone is waiting for me. Now get out there and KILL them all!",
