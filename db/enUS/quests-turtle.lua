For many nights, our ancestors hunted him across the plains and to the ends of the earth. To flee, the great stag leaped into the sky, but his mighty antlers were tangled in the stars. He struggled, to no avail. In that moment, he was noticed by Mu'sha as she chased after her brother, An'she, across the heavens. She found him, and at first glance, fell in love with him. The clever moon made a bargain with the proud stag: if he were to end her loneliness and dedicate his love to her, she would set him free. Many moons later, from their love, the demi-god, Cenarius, was born. Cenarius was meant to walk the starry path between the waking world and the kingdom of the heavens. As a Druid of the Antler, myself and many others were touched by the tenacity of Apa'ro and the love he held for both the wilds and Mu'sha.

I’m not sure if you should over complicate your mind with this, but this is of Necromantic nature, surely you didn’t think Necromancy only used death magic, did you?

I will patiently wait here while I am taking another look at this damn vial, can’t simply understand it currently, must test it more.",

The caravan lays in ruins and you can only find the mutilated husks of what used to be dwarves. Our agents already poked around the zone but failed to find anything, they are currently trying to localize these newly recruited Scarlet zealots. I am not very sure of how much of a detective you believe yourself to be but I ask you to take a second look, maybe they missed something. If you find the recruits, keep in mind that we aren’t sure what manner of persuasion the Scarlets used to brainwash them, spare as many as you can and take them to Menethil.",
