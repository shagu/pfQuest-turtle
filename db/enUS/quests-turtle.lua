West of here is a farm where a large battle occurred recently between our troops and humans of Lordaeron. We planned to use the dead there to boost our troops, but the Cult of the Damned appeared before us with the same idea. If left unchecked, the Scourge will soon have a large force to attack from the west, and we cannot let that happen. If you are feeling up to it, I got a reward ready for anyone willing to put a stop to the Scourge advances.",
