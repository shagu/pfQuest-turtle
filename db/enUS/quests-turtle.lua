For many nights, our ancestors hunted him across the plains and to the ends of the earth. To flee, the great stag leaped into the sky, but his mighty antlers were tangled in the stars. He struggled, to no avail. In that moment, he was noticed by Mu'sha as she chased after her brother, An'she, across the heavens. She found him, and at first glance, fell in love with him. The clever moon made a bargain with the proud stag: if he were to end her loneliness and dedicate his love to her, she would set him free. Many moons later, from their love, the demi-god, Cenarius, was born. Cenarius was meant to walk the starry path between the waking world and the kingdom of the heavens. As a Druid of the Antler, myself and many others were touched by the tenacity of Apa'ro and the love he held for both the wilds and Mu'sha.

I have done much research into the tower itself and the artifacts that once belonged in the ruins around it. I have some hunches, the first of which is that the energy that me, and the other mages have felt is coming from beneath Karazhan. In an old, and decrepid series of catacombs underneath the tower. If I am correct, then we will need an old Pendant which holds power enough to re-energize a key created by Medivh. This artifact is known as the Pendant of Ardan, thought lost for some years now. My only hint is that of the ogres of Deadwind Pass, of which, their leader Var'zhog has begun to exhibit magical prowess. Find Var'zhog, and from him, reclaim the Pendant of Ardan.",

Southwest of here, there is a spirit in this land that cries out in pain. She had no name in life, but the Tauren know her spirit as Palkeote - “grey mother”, in their tongue. Palkeote lost one of her sons in this land long ago, before the sundering of the world. Yet she would not leave his side. She remained here for many long years, as the trees grew and the world changed around her, until at last she too passed at the side of her beloved child. She remains here as a restless spirit. The long years of her life and her dedication to her single task make her mighty, but she has long passed from the warmth of love for kin. You will need many allies to lay her to rest, hero, but that is what I ask you to do.",

He fell further behind the pack with each passing day, until he finally collapsed northwest of here, near a river that has now gone dry. Palkeote stayed with her son, but she could do nothing to stop his passing. She would not leave even then. Her herd moved on and the seasons passed around her, but still she remained, until she herself passed away beside him. Her watch did not end even then, and she remains as a mighty spirit. The Earthmother pities the suffering of all life, and she pities the suffering of mothers most of all. Palkeote's vigil has made her strong, but it is time for her to rest.

I need the following: A thorium tuned servo for the chassis. I only know of one, and it's been locked up by those Scarlet fanatics. I think the armory is where they store objects they consider heretical. Go get it for me! In addition to that, I also need a perfect core for the Pounder. The Dark Iron golems in the Blackrock Depths make a good source. Golem Lord Argelmach probably has one. The last component I need is a high quality adamantite rod used for the endoskeleton. I believe Stratholme's forges used to make such rods in the past. I do not know the state of the city, but I believe the rods may still survive there.",
