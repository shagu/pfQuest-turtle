# pfQuest [TurtleWoW DB]

An extension for [pfQuest](https://github.com/shagu/pfQuest) which adds support for [TurtleWoW](https://turtle-wow.org/).
The latest version of [pfQuest](https://github.com/shagu/pfQuest) is required and only enUS-Gameclients are supported at the time.

It already includes the [Shagu](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=60300) NPC with his [Puffing Peace](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=40001) quest-chain as example. However, I will not add any other quests by myself and all content requests will be silently ignored.

This project is meant as an example on how pfQuest can be extended for custom servers.
The database format in use, is similar to the existing pfQuest databases.
You might want to also look into the "pfQuest-tbc" databases to learn how entries could be removed or manipulated.

If you wish to add more content, feel free to contribute and send [Pull Requests](https://github.com/shagu/pfQuest-turtle/pulls).
