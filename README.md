## Contribute
This project always needs **your** help: If you find a quest that doesn't work for you, please consider looking it up, adding it, and then create a pull request towards this repository. The database format in use, is similar to the pfQuest databases. It uses the same table patching mechanism as in the "pfQuest-tbc" database.

A basic example how things get added, modified and removed can be seen in the commit ([db: add shagu and his quest chain](https://github.com/shagu/pfQuest-turtle/commit/081f48076a9f0a3b44f784d7b8221931986c6af6)), which adds the [Shagu](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?npc=60300) NPC with his [Puffing Peace](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?quest=40001) quest-chain.
